# Fake-News-Predictor-Model
## Aim:-
This repository contains a machine learning project for detecting fake news using Python. The model is built using a logistic regression classifier trained on a dataset of news articles. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature extraction with TF-IDF vectorization, model training, evaluation, and prediction for new inputs.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Load datasets of fake and real news articles from CSV files.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess text data, including removing punctuation, converting to lowercase, and tokenizing.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extract features from text using TF-IDF vectorization.
- **Model Training**: Train a logistic regression classifier on the preprocessed data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- **Prediction**: Predict whether a new piece of news is fake or real based on the trained model.
